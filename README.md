# Multiplayer Guess the Number Game 🎮

## Project Description
This project is a **multiplayer pass-and-play Guess the Number game** developed in **Python**.  
It extends the classic single-player version into a competitive game where multiple players take turns guessing the same secret number across several rounds.

The game focuses on reinforcing **core Python programming concepts** while providing an interactive and fun experience.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I was able to:

- Practice Python fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Use functions to organize game logic
- Work with lists and dictionaries for player and score management
- Implement turn-based logic fairly across multiple players
- Track scores and display a leaderboard
- Build a complete, interactive console-based application

## Game Rules
1. The computer randomly selects a secret number within a defined range.
2. Multiple players participate in the game.
3. Players take turns guessing the number.
4. Each player has a limited number of attempts per round.
5. After each guess, the game provides hints:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Close to the correct number
6. The first player to guess correctly wins the round and earns one point.
7. The game continues for a fixed number of rounds.
8. At the end of the game, the leaderboard is displayed and the player with the highest score wins.
